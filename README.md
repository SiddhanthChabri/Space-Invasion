Space Invasion
Overview
Space Invasion is a 2D space shooter game developed using Python and the Pygame library. As a final-year Computer Science student, I built this project to explore game development fundamentals, focusing on implementing core gameplay mechanics such as player movement, enemy spawning, shooting, and collision detection. The project demonstrates my ability to apply object-oriented programming, event-driven design, and performance optimization to create an engaging, interactive application.
Features

Player Controls: Allows players to move a spaceship using keyboard inputs and shoot bullets to destroy enemies.
Enemy Spawning: Dynamically spawns enemy ships with randomized movement patterns for varied gameplay.
Collision Detection: Handles interactions between player bullets, enemies, and the player’s ship for accurate scoring and game-over conditions.
Custom Assets: Includes custom-designed sprites for the player, enemies, bullets, and background to enhance visual appeal.
Game Loop Optimization: Ensures smooth gameplay through efficient event handling and rendering.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Library: Pygame
Tools: Git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code

Setup Instructions
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
Prerequisites

Python (v3.8 or higher)
Pygame (v2.0 or higher)
Git

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/SiddhanthChabri/Space-Invasion.git
cd Space-Invasion


Install Dependencies:

Install Python if not already installed: Python Downloads
Install Pygame:pip install pygame




Run the Game:

Execute the main game script:python main.py


The game window will open, and you can control the spaceship using arrow keys (movement) and the spacebar (shooting).



Project Structure

main.py: Core game script containing the game loop, event handling, and rendering logic.
assets/: Contains sprite images for the player, enemies, bullets, and background.
scripts/: Includes additional Python modules for game mechanics (e.g., player, enemy, collision detection).

Learning Outcomes
This project strengthened my skills in:

Applying object-oriented programming to create modular, reusable code for game entities (e.g., player, enemies).
Implementing event-driven architecture for real-time user input and game updates.
Optimizing game performance through efficient game loop management and collision detection algorithms.
Managing and integrating graphical assets to enhance user experience.
Documenting code and setup instructions for accessibility and collaboration.

Future Improvements

Add sound effects and background music to enhance immersion.
Implement difficulty levels with increasing enemy speed and spawn rates.
Introduce power-ups or special abilities for the player’s spaceship.
Develop a high-score system with persistent storage.
